# Welcome to Tech Debt Analytics project

This project aims to provide you with functionality to allow you to understand the modernisation needs and velocity of your organisation. The project consists of three main components: `infra`, `shipper`, and `report`.

This `docs/` directory contains detailed documentation for the project instead of filling the README.md with too much information. The README.md file contains a high-level overview of the project and its components.

## Docs
- [Security and authentication](security_and_authentication.md)
- [Application modernisation assessment tooling](appcat.md)
- [Developing functions locally](developing_functions_locally.md)
